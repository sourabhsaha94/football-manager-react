At a time t:
- Pick a team which initiates the attack
- Assign the ball to a player from that team to start the attack
	- Based on the player's attributes decide what to do with the ball
	- The player is given an option to pass, dribble or shoot
	- The choice is picked based on various heuristics and the game progresses
- The defending team relies on the positioning of the defenders at that time
	- The defenders would be close to the attacker closest to them (marking)
	- Interception vs Tackling would be decided based on certain heuristics
- If the ball is intercepted or tackled, then the attack stops
- Next time point is chosen for the players to begin the attack

Each player (off the ball)
- Defender
	- Figure out the distance from the ball
	- Figure out if you want to try and tackle, or stay behind and track your marker
	- Figure out if you want to stay in your zone or move to a different one

- Attacker
	- Figure out the distance from the ball
	- Figure out if you want to ask for pass or stay behind
	- Figure out if you want to stay in your zone or move to a different one

Player (on the ball)
- Figure out your neighbouring players
- Figure out the distance from the goal
- Figure out the next action
	- Figure out if you want to pass the ball
	- Figure out if you want to dribble the ball
	- Figure out if you want to shoot
